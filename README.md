# Battle Monster

This project was created as a Take Home Assignment for the Speak\_ preparation program, and made in collaboration with Charles P.

Link to Charles' repo [Firebase-Srpingboot](https://github.com/ccpink/firebase-springboot).

The project was developed using React, TypeScript, SASS, NES.css, and reads data from the Springboot REST API. The idea was to create a "Yu-gi-oh meets Pokemon" type of game, the player will take turns to attack 2 monsters at a time using magic cards with specific damage and manaCost.
